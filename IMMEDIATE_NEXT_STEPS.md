## üõ†Ô∏è **TECHNICAL SETUP REQUIRED**

### **1. Database Schema Updates**
```sql
-- Add to existing users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN role ENUM('admin', 'manager', 'viewer') DEFAULT 'viewer';
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN profile_picture VARCHAR(255) NULL;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN last_login_at TIMESTAMP NULL;
```

### **2. New Laravel Files to Create**
```bash
# Enums
app/Enums/UserRole.php

# Controllers
app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php
app/Http/Controllers/AdminController.php

# Middleware
app/Http/Middleware/RoleMiddleware.php

# Models
app/Models/ActivityLog.php

# Views
resources/views/users/index.blade.php
resources/views/users/create.blade.php
resources/views/users/profile.blade.php
resources/views/admin/dashboard.blade.php
```

### **3. Routes to Add**
```php
// User management routes
Route::middleware(['auth', 'role:admin'])->group(function () {
    Route::resource('users', UserController::class);
    Route::get('/admin/dashboard', [AdminController::class, 'index']);
});

// Profile routes
Route::middleware('auth')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/profile', [UserController::class, 'profile']);
    Route::put('/profile', [UserController::class, 'updateProfile']);
});
```

## üö® **POTENTIAL CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS**

### **Challenge 1: Existing Data Migration**
**Problem:** Current system has single user
**Solution:** Create migration to assign admin role to existing user

### **Challenge 2: Permission Complexity**
**Problem:** Complex permission matrix
**Solution:** Start simple with 3 roles, expand later

### **Challenge 3: UI Consistency**
**Problem:** New user features must match existing design
**Solution:** Use existing component patterns and styling
